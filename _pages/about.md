title: "About Me"

Just a normal master's student studying data science, witness the explosion of AI and Generative AI in my last year of my Bachelor, and got interested in how this technology works and decided to study data science. And the deeper I went in this area, the more I want to know, and I don't want to become those people I met whom blindly worship and follow the trend of AI, ending up looking to pursue a PhD in the future. 

I am interested in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Generative Models, and Robotics Learning. My overarching goal is to explore how AI systems can learn meaningful representations of the real world for various practical applications. I am particularly motivated by how such representations can enable more efficient and accurate data generation. Furthermore, by integrating robotics, this enables AI systems to interact with humans physically, moving beyond purely digital outputs such as language or visual content generated by LLMs and AI agents.
