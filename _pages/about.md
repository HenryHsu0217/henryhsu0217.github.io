title: "About Me"
---

Just a normal master's student studying data science, looking to pursue a PhD in the future, interested in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Generative Models, and Robotics Learning. My overarching goal is to explore how AI systems can learn meaningful representations of the real world for various practical applications. I am particularly motivated by how such representations can enable more efficient and accurate data generation. Furthermore, by integrating robotics, this enables AI systems to interact with humans physically, moving beyond purely digital outputs such as language or visual content generated by LLMs and AI agents.
